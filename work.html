                <h1>Reframing the Portrait</h1>
                <h2>Class: Image</h2>
                <p>The goal of this project was to use Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom to create an interesting portrayal of text. My subject was my sister, and the text I used was the poem "Never Trust a Mirror" by Erin Hanson. This project pushed my Photoshop and photography abilities while teaching me about composition and editing. <br>

                <h1>Expressive Booklet</h1>
                <h2>Class: Text</h2>
                <p>The goal of this project was to aesthetically arrange text to express the meaning behind the words using minimal shapes/objects. I chose "The Raven" by Edgar Allan Poe. I used Adobe Illustrator, which proved difficult since I am not used to vector based mechanics. However, this project taught me how to arrange text, while the limitations on color and font facilitated creativity</p>

                <h2>Class: Image</h2>
                <p>The goal of this project was to combine image with movement. Thus, I created an animation. The prompt I used was "a twist on a fairy tale". For this project I based it on the story of Rapunzel, the twist being that she had Wifi in her tower. This project exposed me to animating using Photoshop and taught me to be patient with frame by frame animation. </p>

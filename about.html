                <div class="grid-about-small">
                    <p class="push">My name is Solymar Kneale which comes from the Spanish words sun and sea (<em>Sol y Mar</em>). I come from a very artistic family and very much enjoy digital art, watercolor, and pottery. I'm a born and raised Coloradan and spent my childhood living in the mountains. Currently I am pursuing a major in CTD (<em>Creative Technology and Design</em>) with a minor in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I hope my future leads to a job where I can be creative while making people smile in the process.</p>

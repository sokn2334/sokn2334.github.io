                <p>The goal of this project was to use Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom to create an interesting portrayal of text. My subject was my sister, and the text I used was the poem "Never Trust a Mirror" by Erin Hanson. This project pushed my Photoshop and photography abilities while teaching me about composition and editing. <br>
